1.  a) No, you cannot create a 4x3 matrix of values ranging from 2-10
    b) Yes, you can create a 10x10 matrix of 0 and 1
    c) You can use np.count_nonzero() to count the occurrences of a value or use bincount() to count the occurrences
       of a value in a numpy array and print the values you are looking for
    d)
    e)
2.  a)
    b)
    d) if any of the eigenvalues are 0 then the determinate is 0 and the inverse is undefined, determinate is product
       of eigenvalues
    e) Since 0 is not an eigenvalue of A, it follows that A is nonsingular, and hence invertible. If λ is an eigenvalue
       of A, then 1λ is an eigenvalue of the inverse A−1.
3.  a) Yes, you can get the day with the lowest precipitation
    b) Yes
    d) Not in my code
